Why TypeScript + React 

-With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you are typing code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.
-Provides way to describe the shape of the object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete
-Makes maintenance and refactoring large code bases much easier

Type should be used when we building application and interface should be used when we building libraries.
